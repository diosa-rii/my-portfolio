## Reflection
- The most challenging part was intentionally creating and resolving merge conflicts.
- Git helps DevOps teams by tracking changes, allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously, and managing merges safely.
- I faced issues with branch confusion and missing commits; solved them by checking `git status` and switching to the correct branch.
